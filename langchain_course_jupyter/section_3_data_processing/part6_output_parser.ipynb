In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.[195]\\nIn September 2023, the company was approved to intitiate human trials; the company will conduct a six-year study.[196]\\nThe Boring Company\\nIn 2017, Musk founded the Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240\\xa0km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.[197][198] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1\\xa0m) wide, 50-foot (15\\xa0m) long, and 15-foot (4.6\\xa0m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of SpaceX\\'s offices, as that required no permits.[199] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2\\xa0km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. At the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[178] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla\\'s directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[179][180] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[181][182] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk\\'s favor.[183]\\nNeuralink\\nIn 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, with an investment of $100\\xa0million.[184][185] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain to facilitate its merging with machines. At age twelve, Musk sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[44][45]\\nEducation\\nMusk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and Pretoria Boys High School, from where he graduated.[46] Musk was a good but not exceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[47] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother,[48][49] knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way.[50] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[51]\\nMusk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,[52] working odd jobs at a farm and lumber mill.[53] In 1990, he entered Queen\\'s University in Kingston, Ontario.[54][55] In January 2023, Musk was recognized by Guinness World Records for experiencing the \"largest loss of personal fortune in history\" with regards to his financial losses since November 2021, which Guinness quoted a Forbes estimate of $182 billion.[334]\\nMusk\\'s personal wealth is managed by his family office called Excession LLC, formed in 2016 and run by Jared Birchall.[335][261]\\nSources of wealth\\nAround 75% of Musk\\'s wealth was derived from Tesla stock in November 2020,[327] a proportion that fell to about 37% as of December 2022,[f] after selling nearly $40 billion in company shares since late 2021.[336] Musk does not receive a salary from Tesla; he agreed with the board in 2018 to a compensation plan that ties his personal earnings to Tesla\\'s valuation and revenue.[325]'}, {'url': 'https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/elon-musk', 'content': 'Emily Glazer and Kirsten Grind\\nJanuary 7, 2024\\nWhy MrBeast Is Rebuffing Elon Musk\\nOne of the world’s biggest YouTube creators has told the billionaire that the math doesn’t work for him on X.\\nTim Higgins\\nJanuary 6, 2024\\nLabor Board Backs Fired SpaceX Kim Mackrael\\nDecember 18, 2023\\nPage\\nWSJ Membership\\nCustomer Service\\nTools & Features\\nAds\\nMore\\nDow Jones Products The Real Story of Musk’s Twitter Takeover\\nIn an exclusive excerpt from his new biography ‘Elon Musk,’ Walter Isaacson offers a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most surprising and controversial decisions of the mogul’s career.\\n Micah Maidenberg\\nJanuary 3, 2024\\nElon Musk and Italy’s Giorgia Meloni Form a Trans-Atlantic Bond\\nFrom immigration to artificial intelligence, the billionaire and the Italian prime minister are finding common ground.\\n Rebecca Elliott and Sean McLain\\nDecember 22, 2023\\nBezos’ Rocket Startup and Cerberus Compete to Buy SpaceX Rival\\nBlue Origin and Cerberus made buyout bids for a rocket-launch venture owned by Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\\n'}]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThought:The Google search did not directly return Elon Musk's Twitter profile URL.
